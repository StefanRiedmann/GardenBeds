# GardenBeds
This post describes the implementation of a cross platform mobile application that allows the display of different GardenBeds and the different plants on it (details). Itâ€™s meant to demonstrate a complete implementation including testing and dependency injection. User input is not implemented, to keep the example smaller.

This implementation for Android, iOS and UWP comes with my blogpost:
