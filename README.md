# GardenBeds
The implementation for my blogpost http://www.ciclosoftware.com/2017/02/13/gardenbeds/

This post describes the implementation of a cross platform mobile application with Xamarin.Forms and Prism that allows the display of different GardenBeds and the different plants on it (details). Itâ€™s meant to demonstrate a complete implementation including testing and dependency injection. User input is not implemented, to keep the example smaller.

HAPPY PLANTING
